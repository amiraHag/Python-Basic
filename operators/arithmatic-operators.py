#arithmatic operators perform arithmatic calculations in any particular sentex
# + , - , * , / , % , ** , //
#addition operator + : perform the addition process in two different values
x= "amira"
y="HM"
z= x+y
print(z)

#subtraction operator - : perform the subtraction process in two different values
a = 9
b = 3
c= a-b
print(c)

#subtraction operator can not be applied to strings
# z=x-y will get an error

#multiplied oprator * : perform the multiplication process in two different values
#unexpected indent is kind of error that appear if you left space in the start of the sentence or in any place that it shouldn't be space on it
# a="cc" issue an error
a= 8
b= 5
c = 8*5

#division operator / : perform the division process in two different values
a = 12
b = 3
c = a/b
print(c)
# double division operator // : perform the division process -with round the result-  in two different values
a= 10
b= 3
c= a/b
d= a//b
print(c)
print(d)

#reminder operator % : the result is the reminder of the division process in two different values
#the result is the left portion of the division operation
e= a%b
print(e)

#power operator ** : perform the power operation in two different values
v= a**b
print(v)
