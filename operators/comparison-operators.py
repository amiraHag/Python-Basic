#Comparison operators compare two diffrent variables
# comprision operators: == , != , > , >= , < , <=
x=3
y=3
z=5

# equal to operator == : compare if the two variables are the same and the result is true or false
print(x==y)
print(x==z)
print("*******")

# not equal to operator != : is the opposite of ==
print(x!=z)
print("*******")

# greater than operator > : compare if variable value greater than other variable value
print(z>x)
print(y>x)
print("*******")

# greater than operator or equal >= : compare if variable value greater than or equal other variable value
print(z>=x)
print(y>=x)
print("*******")

# less than operator < : compare if variable value less than other variable value
print(x<z)
print(x<y)
print("*******")

# less than operator or equal <= : compare if variable value less than or equal other variable value
print(x<=z)
